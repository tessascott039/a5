It's a true story -- everyy bit of this isas true.
Soon after Tipper and I left the -- (Mock sob) White House -- we were driving from ours hom in Nashville to a little farm we have 50e miss east of Nashville.
Driving ourselves.
I know it soundsce like a little thing to you, but -- I looked in the rear-view mirror and all of a sudden it juste hit me . There was no motorcade backe there.
